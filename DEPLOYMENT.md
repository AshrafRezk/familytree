## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Netlify account (free)

  --source=. \
  --remote=origin \
  --push
```

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/soliman-dawood-family-tree.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌐 Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Build command**: (leave empty)
   - **Publish directory**: `.` (dot)
   - Click "Deploy site"

4. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://random-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Option B: Drag and Drop Deployment

1. **Build the Project** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # The project is already built and ready for deployment
   # Just make sure all files are committed to Git
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop your project folder to the deployment area
   - Netlify will automatically deploy your site

## 🎨 Step 4: Customize Your Site

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to your site settings
   - Click "Domain settings"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `family-tree.yourdomain.com`)

2. **Configure DNS**:
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to your Netlify site
   - Or use Netlify's nameservers for full DNS management

2. **Mobile Testing**:
   - Test on different devices
   - Check touch interactions
   - Verify responsive design

## 🔄 Step 6: Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Updates

- **GitHub Integration**: Every push to `main` branch automatically deploys
- **Preview Deployments**: Pull requests get preview URLs
- **Rollback**: Easy rollback to previous deployments

### Workflow

```bash
# Make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature description"
git push origin main

# Netlify automatically deploys the changes
# Check deployment status at: https://app.netlify.com
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**:
